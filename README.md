## About The Project

Hey! Nice to see you. This is where my Portfolio lives. Thanks for checking it out!

## Overview

I started this website during the first few weeks of a software engineer bootcamp in Summer/Fall 2021. Since completing bootcamp, I have learned other technologies that I look forward to implementing into this website. As I make updates, I will update my roadmap (below). Thank you for your interest!

### How it started:

Featuring my geriatric pup, Scout, AKA the world's best placeholder image generator:

### How it's going:

Featuring my very own face, and some neat background colors (Is that a gradient?! Yes it's a gradient!!):
